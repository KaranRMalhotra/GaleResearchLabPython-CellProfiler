# GaleResearchLabPython-CellProfiler
This project features some of the code I used to access and run CellProfiler in Python, in addition to the CellProfiler analysis pipelines that I created.

Featured in the code/pipelines is cell identification based on global methods like Otsu, which I used to ID neural cell types like Neurons, astrocytes, neural progenitor cells, and oligodendrocytes. 
In addition to cellular identification, the code also features Zika virus infection identification based on similar thresholding of virus protein markers. 
Finally, I developed a novel pipeline for synaptic identification, which is currently being used by the Gale Laboratory. The method creates "rings" around nuclei and then looks for 
colocalization of pre- and post-synaptic markers to interrogate synapse formation under infectious conditions.
